Write an event specific to form element.

> 'onSubmit'.

What is the difference between onInput, onChange, onFocus and onBlur?

> 'onFocus' occurs when an element is first receiving attention (e.g. selecting an input field). 'onBlur' occurs when an element is no longer receiving attention (e.g. clicking off of an input field). 'onInput' occurs when the user changes content (e.g. typing, pasting, up-down arrows, etc.). 'onChange' occurs *after* a change is made, and *before* a blur event is triggered.

Where do we put the onSubmit event?

> As an attribute in a form element.
